### Procedural Track Generator

![track image](/Images/Track/Track_screenshot.png)

As a part of my final year computing project, I developed a prototype procedural race track generator. This worked by generating a terrain for the track, then positioning nodes on a grid for corners. Using an A* algorithm, the nodes are then connected to form a track. A mesh is constructed using the nodes in the grid as a reference for polygon positions.

### Artificial Intelligence Project

For our AI project at University, we had to develop a game prototype that had different aspects of artificial intelligence. I primarily worked on the decision making aspect, implementing a finite state machine for our Zombie AI. I also assisted with the implementation of the A* pathfinding that the Zombies use.
